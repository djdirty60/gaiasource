			The goal is to wait for the container to finish loading before setting the view and/or position.
			Setting the view/position before the container has finished loading does not work and the container remains unchanged afterwards.
			The problem is that there is no way, either through Python or through the built-in functions and InfoLabels, to determine when the container has finished loading.
			It still takes a few 100 ms after xbmcplugin.endOfDirectory() for Kodi to finish loading the menu.

			Trying to access the Container, ControlList, and ListItem through Python also does not work.
			Although it is possible to get the Container and ControlList through Python, the ControlList is always empty.
			This has been reported on ther Kodi forums multiple times since 2012, and is therefore unlikley to be fixed.
			Getting the size, position, current item, etc from the ControlList is therefore not possible in Python.
			Strangely enough, it is still possible to call setters on the ControlList (eg ControlList.selectItem() does change the selected position, even when size() == 0).

			One possibility is to add a unique ID to a menu/container and check if that ID has changed when navigating from one menu to the next.
				1. Calling xbmcplugin.setProperty() is useless, since that value is set (and retrievable) before the container finished loading.
				2. The only reliable way to determine if the container finished loading is to check if the ListItems in ther container have been initialized/loaded.
				   As already mentioned, trying to access the ControlList/ListItem from Python does not work, since the list is always returned empty.
				   The only possiblity is to use the InfoLabels to get the values from the container/list.
				   	a. Using Container.FolderPath sometimes works, but in most cases this value has changed before the container finished loading.
				   	b. The best option seems to be to set a custom property on the first ListItem. The problem is that it is impossible to access custom properties using InfoLabels.
					   It is only possible by skins and custom XML that have direct access to the ListItem.Property(...). Custom properties cannot be accessed through Container(id).ListItem(offset).Property.
					c. Another option is to use an unused info label set in Python by ListItem.setInfo() which is accessible from Container(id).ListItem(offset).Info.
					   The problem here is that we might use an info label that might be used/displayed elsewhere, like the Kodi info Dialog.
					   Setting an unknown/custom label with ListItem.setInfo(), throws a warning in the Kodi log.
					   Additionally, it can take a few seconds (not ms) to access info labels through Container(id).ListItem(offset), which causes a delay while setting the view/position.
					d. The final solution is to read the the core attributes from Container(id).ListItem(offset), which seem to be fast and don't have the delay of c. above.
							cid).ListItem(offset).Label
							Container(id).ListItem(offset).Icon
					   Use both these, since it is unlikley that the first item of a submenu has the same label AND icon.
					   It is however possible for the first submenu item to have the same icon, and in a few cases maybe the same label, but not both.
					   So if the label+icon of the first item changed, we can assume that the list finished loading.

			Update:
				It seems that setting an custom property on ListItem is accessible from the InfoLabels.
				Note that there are different ways of getting the ListItem:
					Container(...).ListItem(...)
					Container(...).ListItemPosition(...)
					Container(...).ListItemNoWrap(...)
					Container(...).ListItemAbsolute(...)
				The first 3 can be off if the menu is reloaded and Kodi automatically selects the previously selected item.
					Eg: Container(...).ListItem(0)
				Might not select the 1st item, but the 1st item visible after Kodi automatically selects the item.
				Use Container(...).ListItemAbsolute(...) instead.

			Update 2:
				There is one small problem with the implementation below.
				If we currently have some Gaia menu opened and hit Backspace twice realy quickly, Kodi exits the addon and goes to the main menu (this seems to be standard Kodi behaviour).
				However, once Backspace is hit the first time, Kodi starts navigating to the parent menu, which in turn will call this function.
				When Backspace is hit the second time shortly after, Kodi interprets this as exiting the current addon, and initiates the exit protocol.
				However, since this function was initiated from the first Backspace hit, the loop below is still running while Kodi waits for the Python interpreter to stop.
				After 5 seconds of Kodi waiting, Kodi kills the interpreter (while the loop below is still running):
					ERROR <general>: CPythonInvoker(289, .kodi/addons/plugin.video.gaia/addon.py): script didn't stop in 5 seconds - let's kill it
					ERROR <general>: GetDirectory - Error getting plugin://plugin.video.gaia/?action=moviesLists&kids=0&type=movie
					ERROR <general>: CGUIMediaWindow::GetDirectory(plugin://plugin.video.gaia/?action=moviesLists&kids=0&type=movie) failed
				System.aborted() is False during this, which is probably a bug in Kodi.
				Trying to retrieve any value with System.infoLabel(InfoLabel) or System.visible(BooleanCondition) does not help, since nothing indicates we are exiting the addon.
				It seems the only way is to let Kodi kill the addon after 5 secs, which will then causes a "System Exit" exception with current xbmc calls, mostly in Time.sleep().
				That is why the sleep() call is wrapped in its own try-catch, with the catch part returning False.
				Also note that hitting Backspace twice is not the same as hitting Esc.
