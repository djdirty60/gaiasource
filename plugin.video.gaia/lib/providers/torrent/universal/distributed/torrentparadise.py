# Domain is down and will probably not come back up.

# The new website is located at:
#	IPFS HASH:
#		QmQjsKamNFZRvCMXDvZXQmRYjsmSkmZG5pBCTY4LtMj8hs
#		Qme21itRkXCq5Comc48FMKURNwRaJguYNeNj6vmxh3fqzd
#	https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/<IPFS HASH>/
#	https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<IPFS HASH>/
#	https://dweb.link/ipfs/<IPFS HASH>/
# However, it runs the "ifps"" version where searching is done locally via JS, instead of using the "static" version of the website that does pre-searching and has a JSON API.
# A HTTP API exists, but there sre not useful links returned:
#	https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ipfs-search/ipfs-search/1.0.2

# gaiaremove - Does a new domain exist yet?
# gaiaremove - Can we somehow convert the JS on the website to Python?
# gaiaremove - Or maybe even execute the JS in a Python-JS interpreter?
