	In future extensions when TMDb/Trakt/IMDb is added:
		1. Make the "season" function callable by season ID/query/year or by show ID/query/year.
		2. Make the "episode" function callable by episode ID/query/year or by season ID/query/year or by show ID/query/year.
		3. Trakt and IMDb seem to require the show ID + season/episode number, instead of using separate season/episode IDs.
		4. That means each function should get additional parameters for the above.
		5. Also put the implementation of this in the subclasses, instead of abstracting everything in the parent class. Would make things easier to code, since every provider is very different on its parameter requirnments.
		6. Update "CacheParameters"
		7. Maybe also do this with the id(...) lookup in _idDefault(), since subclasses might treat id lookups differently.
		8. Maybe also make the "year" parameter (and maybe the "query" parameter as well) to take in a list of values. And/or add a "yearFrom" and "yearTo" that is then converted to a list of years. Some providers, like Trakt support requests with year ranges. Will be more efficient for shows.py -> _details() for looking up the year +- 1.
		9. Maybe change the levels: l1=basic, l2=extended, l3=super-extended, l4=threaded-down, l5=threaded-up (for better consistency between providers).
		10. NB: Improve the speed of providers. Currently it can take 3secs+ just to process a show on level6 (excluding the API request time). A problem does not seem to be the data extraction, but rather _process() in TVDb. Some delays are caused by the dataUpdate() function in metadata.
