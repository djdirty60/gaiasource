Current Version:	5.5.0 (2022-11-16) and older versions for older Pythons
Used By:			Gaia

The native "json" module in Python is relativly slow at encoding/decoding JSON. Ujson is used by Gaia to improve the
performance of JSON processing. Depending on the device, Ujson can be 20% - 60% faster than the native "json" module.

Gaia will first attempt to use the Ujson module installed in the local Python environment used by Kodi, and only use
these modules if the native module is not available. Ujson is not a pure Python library, but is operating-system
specific, Python-version specific, and written in C. Ujson therefore needs to be compiled beforehand. There are
binaries for most systems and versions, but some older ARM architectures might not be supported. The binary libraries
can be manually verified by comparing their hash to the files from the websites who's URLs are listed above. Note that
libraries must first be extracted from the Python wheels on the websites before calculating the hash. Also note that not
all libraries might be from the latests version. Older versions can be found on pypi.org under the "Release history" tab.

The following operating systems and architectures should be supported:
1. Linux						x86 [32bit + 64bit]		Tested
2. Windows						x86 [32bit + 64bit]		Tested
3. Mac							x86 [64bit] and ARM		Untested
4. ARM [Linux + Android]		Various architectures	Partially tested (at least newer Raspberry and Odroid should work)
